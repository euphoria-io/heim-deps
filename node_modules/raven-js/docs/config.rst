Configuration
=============

We must first configure the client to allow certain hosts to report
errors.  This prevents abuse so somebody else couldn't start sending
errors to your account from their site.

**Note**: Without setting this, all messages will be rejected!

This can be found under the *Project Details* page in Sentry.

Now need to set up Raven.js to use your Sentry DSN.

.. code-block:: javascript

    Raven.config('___PUBLIC_DSN___').install()

At this point, Raven is ready to capture any uncaught exception.

Although, this technically works, this is not going to yield the greatest
results. It's highly recommended to next check out :doc:`usage`.

Optional settings
-----------------

``Raven.config()`` can be passed an optional object for extra configuration.

.. describe:: logger

    The name of the logger used by Sentry. Default: ``javascript``

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          logger: 'javascript'
        }

.. describe:: release

    Track the version of your application in Sentry.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          release: '721e41770371db95eee98ca2707686226b993eda'
        }

    Can also be defined with ``Raven.setReleaseContext('721e41770371db95eee98ca2707686226b993eda')``.

.. describe:: tags

    Additional `tags <https://www.getsentry.com/docs/tags/>`__ to assign to each event.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          tags: {git_commit: 'c0deb10c4'}
        }

.. _config-whitelist-urls:

.. describe:: whitelistUrls

    The inverse of ``ignoreUrls``. Only report errors from whole urls
    matching a regex pattern or an exact string. ``whitelistUrls`` should
    match the url of your actual JavaScript files. It should match the url
    of your site if and only if you are inlining code inside ``<script>``
    tags.

    Does not affect ``captureMessage`` or when non-error object is passed in
    as argument to captureException.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          whitelistUrls: [/getsentry\.com/, /cdn\.getsentry\.com/]
        }

.. describe:: ignoreErrors

    Very often, you will come across specific errors that are a result of
    something other than your application, or errors that you're
    completely not interested in. `ignoreErrors` is a list of these
    messages to be filtered out before being sent to Sentry as either
    regular expressions or strings.

    Does not affect captureMessage or when non-error object is passed in
    as argument to captureException.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          ignoreErrors: ['fb_xd_fragment']
        }

.. describe:: ignoreUrls

    The inverse of ``whitelistUrls`` and similar to ``ignoreErrors``, but
    will ignore errors from whole urls matching a regex pattern or an
    exact string.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          ignoreUrls: [/graph\.facebook\.com/, 'http://example.com/script2.js']
        }

    Does not affect captureMessage or when non-error object is passed in
    as argument to ``captureException``.

.. describe:: includePaths

    An array of regex patterns to indicate which urls are a part of your
    app in the stack trace. All other frames will appear collapsed inside
    Sentry to make it easier to discern between frames that happened in
    your code vs other code. It'd be suggested to add the current page
    url, and the host for your CDN.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
            includePaths: [/https?:\/\/getsentry\.com/, /https?:\/\/cdn\.getsentry\.com/]
        }

.. describe:: dataCallback

    A function that allows mutation of the data payload right before being
    sent to Sentry.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
            dataCallback: function(data) {
              // do something to data
              return data;
            }
        }

.. describe:: shouldSendCallback

    A callback function that allows you to apply your own filters to
    determine if the message should be sent to Sentry.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
            shouldSendCallback: function(data) {
              return false;
            }
        }

.. describe:: maxMessageLength

    By default, raven truncates messages to a max length of 100
    characters. You can customize the max length with this parameter.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

.. code-block:: html

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Awesome stuff happening here</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
        <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script src="//cdn.ravenjs.com/1.1.18/jquery,native/raven.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            Raven.config('___PUBLIC_DSN___', {
                logger: 'my-logger',
                whitelistUrls: [
                    /disqus\.com/,
                    /getsentry\.com/
                ],
                ignoreErrors: [
                    'fb_xd_fragment',
                    /ReferenceError:.*/
                ],
                includePaths: [
                    /https?:\/\/(www\.)?getsentry\.com/
                ]
            }).install();
        </script>
        <script src="myapp.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>

TraceKit specific optional settings
-----------------------------------

Usually there is no need to touch these settings, but they exist in case
you need to tweak something.

.. describe:: fetchContext

    Enable TraceKit to attempt to fetch source files to look up anonymous
    function names, this can be useful to enable if you don't get the context
    for some entries in the stack trace. Default value is ``false``.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
            fetchContext: true
        }

.. describe:: linesOfContext

    The count of lines surrounding the error line that should be used as
    context in the stack trace, default value is ``11``. Only applicable when
    ``fetchContext`` is enabled.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
            linesOfContext: 11
        }

.. describe:: collectWindowErrors

    Enable or disable the TraceKit ``window.onerror`` handler, default
    value is ``true``.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        {
            collectWindowErrors: true
        }
